# CitiBike Data Analysis
### Project Overview
In order to pitch our idea for city bike rentals in Des Moines, Iowa to investers, we created a series of data visualization using Tableau

### Data Visualizations and Results

Our first visualization shows the proportion of users who are subscribers (~1,900,000) and those who are not (~440,000).

### Conclusions
After reviewing the summer data for New York Citie's rental program, citibike, we have come to several conclusions. First and foremost. Initial investment in Des Moines is going to be lower than expected. this is do to three primary reasons. First, the infrastructure in Des Moines is not ideal for commuting via bike. Second, adoption will take significant time. This means we do not need to get all the bikes out at the start. We should prioritize specific locations where the bikes will be most frequently seen, in order to get the word out. Lastly, the initial usage will be minimal, relatively speaking. Tourism is much smaller in Des Moines and traffic is not as bad as in New York City. Furthermore, we will priorize a subscription model for these reasons.

#### Possible Future Analysis
In order to continue to predict the viability of this venture. I would propose analysing data from another small city in the United States. This data would most likely translate better to Des Moines. I would also determine where the first stations for the bikes should be located.
